Review: Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.

Review: I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.
