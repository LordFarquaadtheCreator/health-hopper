Review: I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.

Review: Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best.
