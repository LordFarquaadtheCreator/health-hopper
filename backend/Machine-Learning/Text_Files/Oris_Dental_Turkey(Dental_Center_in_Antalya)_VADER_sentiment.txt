Review: Just completed my final treatment at Oris Dental and the results are so much more amazing than I expected. Cannot praise or recommend them highly enough for the care and professionalism in how they treat their patients.
The best hospitality, staff are amazing. Everyone was lovely and helpful and made me feel welcome throughout the process. My teeth look amazing and I'm grateful for what the doctors did. I would definitely be recommending friends and family here as they just incredible with what they do!
Many thanks.

Review: I visited this dental clinic for a few procedures. I have an ongoing implant - which is going great and I've had no problem or pain so far - I had a root canal treatment followed by a filling which were both amazing. The filled tooth looks just like other teeth!
Both dentists (Dr. Dervişhan Küçük and Dr. Nehir Yapar) are highly professional and kind.
All other staff are quite welcoming and approachable.
