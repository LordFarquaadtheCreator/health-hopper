Review: This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included

Review: Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.

Review: Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much

Review: AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.

Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED

Review: I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey.

Review: I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards
