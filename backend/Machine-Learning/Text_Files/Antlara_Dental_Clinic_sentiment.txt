Review: This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.

Review: These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

Review: I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.

Review: What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .

Review: After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.

Review: My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.
