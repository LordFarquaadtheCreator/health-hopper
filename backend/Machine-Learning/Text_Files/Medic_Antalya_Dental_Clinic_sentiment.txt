Review: Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!

Review: I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!

Review: I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend

Review: I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!

Review: Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
